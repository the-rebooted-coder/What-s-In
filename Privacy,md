# Privacy Policy for What's In

**Last Updated:** February 12, 2026

## 1. Introduction
"What's In" ("the App") is a utility application developed by OneSiliconDiode. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains that we do **not** collect, store, or share any of your personal information.

## 2. Data Collection
We do not collect any personal data.
* **No Sign-up:** You do not need to create an account to use the App.
* **No Tracking:** We do not track your location, usage patterns, or device identifiers.
* **No Analytics:** The App does not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics or Firebase) to track user behavior.

## 3. Data Usage
The App uses your device's internet connection solely for the following purpose:
* **Fetching Menu Data:** The App connects to a public repository (GitHub Gist) to retrieve the latest weekly menu configuration. This is a read-only operation.

## 4. Local Storage
The App may store the fetched menu data locally on your device to allow functionality when you are offline. This data is stored securely within the App's sandbox on your Windows device and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## 5. Notifications
The App schedules local notifications (Toast Notifications) on your device to remind you of meal times. These notifications are generated locally by the App. No data regarding your notification preferences or habits is transmitted to external servers.

## 6. Third-Party Services
The App fetches data from GitHub. Please note that while we do not collect your data, requests made to GitHub to fetch the menu file are subject to [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement), which may log standard web request information (such as IP address) for security and operational purposes.
